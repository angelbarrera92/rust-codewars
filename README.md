# Learning by doing - Rust

It is mid 2023, and I want to learn Rust.
The purpose of this repository is to learn Rust by doing. For sure you'll find a lot of bad code here, but I hope to improve over time.
You will find the code to be looking like a mix of Python and Go, but I hope to get more idiomatic over time.
